# Python Extras

This lab is for your own benefit. You will work with a partner but take your own notes in your own lab. 

Remember, these labs persist, so you will have these notes to study when you have questions about scope and/or functions.

{% next %}

## Scope

Working with your partner, read through lines 1 - 11 of `scope.py` and see if you can work out what `test_swap` will do when you run it.

After discussing that with your partner, run the script interactively by typing in 

`python -i scope.py`

and pressing return.

Now, type  

`test_swap()` 

and press return.

Discuss the results with your partner, compare this to what you expected. Take notes in the file (in the multiline string near the bottom).

{% next %}

## More Scope

Working with your partner, read through lines 12 - 25 of `scope.py` and see if you can work out what `test_scope` will do when you run it.

Now, type  

`test_scope()` 

and press return.

Discuss the results with your partner, compare this to what you expected. Take notes in the file (in the multiline string near the bottom).

## Functions

Close the interative shell by typing CTRL-D and pressing return.

Working with your partner, read through `functions.py` and see if you can work out what the functions will do when you run them.

After discussing that with your partner, run the script interactively by typing in 

`python -i functions.py`

and pressing return.

Now, run the following blocks of code, discuss, take notes.

```
a()
a(3)
a(3, 4)
a(3, 4, 5)

b()
b(3)
b(3, 4)
b(3, 4, 5)

c()
c(3)
c(3, 4)
c(3, 4, 5)

d()
d(3)
d(r=6, z=9, name='Bill')

e()
e(3)
e(x=4)
e(3, x=4)
e(x=4, 3)
d(4, 5, 6, r=6, z=9, name='Bill')

```
