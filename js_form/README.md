# Simple JavaScript Apps

## Getting Started

Start by creating a copy of the file `mypage.html` so you can start fresh for each app. 

{% next %}

## Ready to Start?

Open your newly copied html file in a text editor window and begin building an app.

Your first app should be a form that lets the user enter two different number, then choose the operation with the dropdown, then click the button, and the answer shows up on the page or in an alert box. 

Try to do this witout adding any new HTML. Just add code in the  `<script></script>` element and you can edit the HTML elements, just don't add any. 

Just for fun...

* All of you know how to do this and have the answer pop up in an alert box, but see if you can have the answer show up on the page instead.
* See if you can have the submit button change what it reads when the user changes the dropdown. 

## How to Test Your App

Type http-server in the terminal and click on the link. You will open a new browser window with your web page. Test your app.

When you're done, click Next.

{% next %}

## Try a few more

Make another copy of the HTML file and build another app. 

Build as many as you'd like - but you are not allowed to pull in any other Javascript files (or libraries) which you did not right. Any files you include must also not include any Javascript you did not write. 

No libraries like jQuery, backbone, whatever. None of that.

When you're ready to submit your apps, click Next.

{% next %}
