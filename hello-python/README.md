## Hello, Python!

You've already created Hello in C. Today, you will be writing what might be your first Python program!

{% next %}

You will write your hello program in the file to the right, hello.py. As you see in the video above, you can type in one line of code

```python
print("hello, world")
```

To execute your code, and simply type in 

```
python hello.py
```
in the lower terminal window.


Since Python is an interpreted language, there is no need to compile! 

```
python hello.py
```
in the lower terminal window.

{% next "Ready for the next step?" %}

Now that was almost too easy!

Let's make this a bit more interesting now by adding user input and saying hello, followed by whatever name you choose to input.

No matter how you execute this program right now, it only ever prints hello, world.

Let's change this code to interact with the user like this, when executed.

```
python hello.py
Name: Alice
hello, Alice
```

There will be a few important differences to create this program. You will need to get user input, and CS50 makes some easy to use functions to help you with this. To access these user input functions you will have to import them from a special cs50 module. In this case you will want to import a name, which is considered a `string` so you will want to import get_string.

```python
from cs50 import get_string
```

A string in computer science essentially refers to a collection of characters—​a word, a sentence, or a phrase. Because when you ask the user for their name, you would use get_string to collect their input and to store it in a variable whose data type is string.

We can now use get_string("Name: "), where "Name: " is the user prompt, and assign the user's input to a variable, such as `name`.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

```python
name = get_string("Name: ")
```
{% endspoiler %}

Now the user input (hopefully a name!), will be stored in the variable `name`.

What else will change, though? Well, we need to change the print statement to include the name! 

In Python, we can pass in multiple variables into the print function, which will print them for us on the same line, separated by a space automatically.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

If the variable `name` contains the string, `Alice`, I can print out `hello, Alice` like this:

```python
print("hello,", name)
```

{% endspoiler %}

{% next %}

When you are done be sure to execute your program, testing it a few times with different inputs, with:

```
python hello.py
```
{% next %}

When all looks good, it's time to run your code through `check50`. This will run a series of test cases through your code and give you a final verdict as to whether or not your code meets the program spec.

In the terminal, type in:

```
check50 cs50/2018/fall/sentimental/hello
```

when you get all green smiley faces, you know your done! Congratulations! You've completed your first Python program!
