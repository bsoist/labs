# CSS

In your last lab, you practiced your HTML skills a little. 

Today, you will learn a little bit about how to "style" your HTML with CSS.

Let's start by watching a short introduction to CSS.

{% next "Let's get started!" %}

## Your Environment

Take a look at your development environment. You should notice two tabs near the top. One for each of the two files you'll be using - `mypage.html` which is where you will past the html from your website, and `style.css` which is where you will be adding all of your CSS.

First, let's copy in your html. Open the html-7 lab in another tab, copy all of the html and text from the `mypage.html` file and then paste it in the `mypage.html` file in this lab. 

Now, make sure you upload any images here which you uploaded and used in your website.

Down below, you should notice a tab for the terminal. Just like the last lab, we don't really need the terminal until we submit, so let's open a browser tab down there by clicking the + next to the terminal tab and clicking _Browser_.

Then type in `/mypage.html` after the 8083 just like you did in the last lab and then press return (or enter).

You should now see a preview of your website.

**Check with your teacher now to be sure you're ready to move on.**

Now, click on the `style.css` tab and let's add some style.

{% next "Let's add some color!" %}

## Adding Color

Let's start by making the background a different color - blue - and the color of everything white.

Add this bit of code to your `style.css` file.

```
body {
    background: blue;
}

* {
    color: white;
}

```

Click the refresh button on your mini-browser window to see your changes.

No changes, right?

{% next "Let's fix that" %}

## Using an external stylesheet

We need to tell the html page to use our stylesheet.

Click on the `mypage.html` tab and inside of the `<head></head>` type in the following:

`<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />`

It can go on the line before or after the title.

Refresh your mini-browser now and you should see the changes.

Click back into your `style.css` file and let's add more style.

{% next "Starting with color" %}

## More Color

Let's make the headings green

```
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    color: green;
}
```

and the list items orange

```
li {
    color: black;
}
```

Now, let's look at a different kind of selector - a "class"

Find at least two list elements (those that have the `<li>` and `</li>` around them) which have some similar characteristics. For example, if you have a list of favorite foods, maybe two of them are desserts. In that case, youre "class" would be "dessert". Or if you have a list of favorite movies, maybe three of them are action movies, so your "class" would be "action"

Let's go ahead and add the class to those elements.

Click into your `mypage.html` file and edit the list items to have a class attribute.

For example, if you have this...

```
<li>cookies</>
<li>pizza</>
<li>ice cream</>
```

you will change it to this...

```
<li class="dessert">cookies</>
<li>pizza</>
<li class="dessert">ice cream</>
```

Now, click into your `style.css` file and add this ruleset...

```
.dessert {
    color: pink;
}
```

Refresh your mini-browser at the bottom and see your changes.

{% next "Let's change the font sizes" %}

## Font Sizes

Your browser already makes the headings a little bigger, but let's really increas the main heading.

```
h1 {
    font-size: 4em;
}
```

{% next "Now, let's change up those bullets" %}

## Styling Lists

```
ul {
    list-style-type: square
}
```

That's pretty cool, but let's try something a little fancier.

Change that rule you just pasted in so it reads like this...

```
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

Refresh your mini-browser at the bottom and see your changes. Note that the bullets should be completely gone now.

and then add this rule

```
ul li:before {
  content: 'âœ“ ';
}
```

Refresh your mini-browser at the bottom and see your changes. Now you've added some content before the item to simulate your own bullet.

{% next "Let's dress up the links a little %}

## Styling Links

Let's get rid of the underline and change up the colors a bit.

```
a, a:visited, a:active {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

Now, let's underline the link when the user hovers over it and change the color to Tower Hill green.

```
a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: rgb(20, 55, 32);
}
```

Refresh your mini-browser and hover over the links.

{% next "Cool, right?" %}

## Positioning

This can be a little tricky, but we'll experiment a bit.

First, let's put borders around the paragraphs so we can see what's happening.

```
p {
    border: solid #ffffff;
}
```

Refresh your mini-browser and see the changes.

Now, let's add some margin.

Add these rules to your paragraph ruleset

```
    margin-top: 50px;
    margin-left: 100px;
```

{% spoiler %}

```
p {
    border: solid #ffffff;
    background: rgb(20, 55, 32);
    margin-top: 50px;
    margin-left: 100px;
}
```

{% endspoiler %}

Refresh your mini-browser and see the changes.

Notice that the paragraph itself is pushed down 50px and over to the right by 100px. You can see this because we have a border around it. 

Now add some padding

```
    padding-left:50px;
```

{% spoiler %}

```
p {
    border: solid #ffffff;
    background: rgb(20, 55, 32);
    margin-top: 50px;
    margin-left: 100px;
    padding-left:50px;
}
```

{% endspoiler %}

Refresh your mini-browser and see the changes.

Notice this time that the paragraph itself is not moved, but that the content inside the border is moved instead. This is the difference between margin and padding.

{% next %}

## How to submit

In the terminal, type the following command

`submit50 tsoistmann/problems/2019/css`

and press return (or enter)

{% next %}

## Now it's time to experiment

### To get more help with HTML and CSS

Go back and edit the page so the colors, font-sizes, and other styles are more like you like them.

If you'd like some inspiration, or would like to learn more, the videos and links below are a good place to start.

Also, you can submit this as many times as you'd like if you want Mr. Soistmann to see the different versions of your page.
