# Create Your Own Search Engine

## Getting Ready

Ok, so you won’t be building an entire search engine from scratch, but a front-end to some of your favorite sites to search. You can style it, customize it, make it your own! It’s still pretty cool!

If you'd like a review of what we discussed in class, watch the video below starting at the 1:18:29 point, until about 1:23:18. During that portion, David builds a search engine front end for Google. After this he demonstrates using CSS to style his page.

## Test It Out

Open a webbrowser window, pop it out into a separate tab (the submission of the form doesn't work if you don't) and then test each form.

## Your Turn

Now, add at least three more forms to search other sites. Not every site will work this way, but I know Google will (see David's example) and Amazon.com will. See if you can set both of those up and at least one other.

Or just choose three of your own.

When you're sure they all work, submit them.

## How to Submit

You may then submit by typing in at the command line:
