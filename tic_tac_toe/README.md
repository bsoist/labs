# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Getting Started

Start by creating a copy of the file `mypage.html` so you can revert if you really mess up.

{% next %}

## Ready to Start?

Open your newly copied html file in a text editor window and begin building an app.

You must do this witout adding OR EDITING any HTML. Just add code in the  `<script></script>` element.

Don't worry about turn order for now - or using filled spaces. Assume the user will play the right letter in an empty box.

No libraries like jQuery, backbone, whatever. None of that.

## How to Test Your App

Type http-server in the terminal and click on the link. You will open a new browser window with your web page. Test your app.

When you have this working, show your teacher.
