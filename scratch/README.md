## tl;dr

Program in Scratch

## Itching to Program?

Head to https://scratch.mit.edu/ and sign up for an account on MIT’s website by clicking Join Scratch atop the page. Any username (that’s available) is fine, but take care to remember it and your choice of password.

Then head to https://scratch.mit.edu/ideas/ and take note of the resources available to you before you dive into Scratch itself. In particular, you might want to check out the Getting Started Guide.

Next try your hand at Pikachu’s Pastry Catch by (former student) Gabe Walker! Click the green flag and then, per Gabe’s instructions, hit your keyboard’s space bar, at which point the game will begin! Feel free to procrastinate a bit.
